# Nonlinear feedback control mechanism (NFCM): An efficient mechanism for simultaneous spread of the positive and negativev information in online social networks (OSNs)
Noting: our project is in progess and will be improved in the future

NFCM has been proposed for simultaneous spread of the positive and negative information in OSNs. As shown in Figure 1, the work process of NFCM consists of five steps:

Specifically, a novel computational model is first proposed to present the temporal dynamics of the positive and negative information spread. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism restrains the negative information spread with minimal system expenses by devising and performing three synergetic intervention strategies.

The efficiency of the proposed mechanism is validated based on the extensive experimental results obtained from two real-world networks (i.e., Slashdot and Epinions).
