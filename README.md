# NFCM-mechanism  

//our project is in progess and will be improved in the future

we propose an efficient feedback control mechanism NFCM for simultaneous spread of the positive and negative information in OSNs. Specifically, a novel computational model is first proposed to present the temporal dynamics of the positive and negative information spread. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism restrains the negative information spread with minimal system expenses by devising and performing three synergetic intervention strategies.
