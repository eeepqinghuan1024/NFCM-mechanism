# NFCM-mechanism
We propose an efficient nonlinear feedback control mechanism NFCM for joint positive and negative information spread in online social networks. In detail, this mechanism intensively evaluates the number of seed users performing three intervention strategies. Besides, each seed user performs the received control task independently. Then, the control plan for the next time step is adjusted dynamically according to previous feedback results.
